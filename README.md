How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To make sure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I will follow coding best practices such as consistent formatting and naming conventions. I will also be fully committed to fulfill requirements and ensuring the quality of my code. when it comes to testing, I will try my best to not let bias influence my testing approach. I will still analytical and assume that my code likely has errors.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs will be outlined in the requirements document. Should the document not fully reflect the needs of the user then, further collaboration with them will be needed. It is important that their needs are understood and met as much as technically possible. 

How do I approach designing software?
Iterative development tends to be best for designing software. I do my very best to use this approach as often as possible. Writing bits of code, reviewing, and testing it before moving on. This helps a lot in catching errors early and avoiding technical debt later on.
